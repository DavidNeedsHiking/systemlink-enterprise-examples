ESS Parts Failure Analysis Report
Generated: 2026-02-06 11:24:12
======================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
The ESS parts (ESS-567, ESS-568, ESS-569) show a consistent ~25% failure rate
across all dimensions analyzed. This suggests a systematic issue in the test
program rather than specific parts, operators, or equipment.

OVERALL STATISTICS
------------------
Total ESS Tests: 6,005
Passed: 1,478
Failed: 1,535
Overall Failure Rate: 25.6%

FAILURE RATE BY PART NUMBER
---------------------------
ESS-567: 548 / 2,118 = 25.9%
ESS-568: 482 / 1,942 = 24.8%
ESS-569: 505 / 1,945 = 26.0%

FAILURE RATE BY OPERATOR
------------------------
APerin: 425 / 1,489 = 28.5% <-- HIGHEST
RayInda: 370 / 1,449 = 25.5%
MSchim: 350 / 1,518 = 23.1%
KanC: 371 / 1,459 = 25.4%

FAILURE RATE BY TEST BAY
------------------------
NI BTS Bay 1: 499 / 2,045 = 24.4%
NI BTS Bay 2: 520 / 1,994 = 26.1%
NI BTS Bay 3: 516 / 1,966 = 26.2%

FAILURE RATE BY SERIAL NUMBER
-----------------------------
429-761: 520 / 2,034 = 25.6%
568-122: 479 / 1,924 = 24.9%
466-778: 516 / 1,955 = 26.4%

KEY FINDINGS
------------
1. No single root cause - failures evenly distributed across all dimensions
2. Slight operator variance: APerin (28.5%) vs MSchim (23.1%) = 5.4% delta
3. All 3 ESS parts have nearly identical failure rates (~25%)
4. All 3 test bays have similar failure rates (24-26%)
5. All 3 serial numbers have similar failure rates (25-26%)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Review test limits in HPPC Battery Analytics Dashboard program
2. Investigate if 25% failure rate is acceptable for this test type
3. Monitor operator APerin for potential training opportunity
4. Check if test specification matches product requirements
